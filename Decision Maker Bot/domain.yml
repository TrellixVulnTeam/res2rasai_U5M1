  utter_preferences:
  - text: "Preference is a set of choices of actions for each state where the first action in the preference set has the highest or equal priority over the next action. There needs to be at least one preferred action to each state and any state need not have all actions in it's preference set. Example: In Tiger Problem, the preferences are defined as : Tiger on the left (TL): Open Right (OR),Listen (L) and Tiger on the right (TR):Open Left (OL), Listen (L), thus we observe that if the Tiger is on the left then the preferred action would be to open the right door and the next preferred action would be to listen. Go ahead and input your preferences in the following input box as comma separated (For Example,OL,L) and then click 'Done'"
  
  utter_symmetry:
  - text: "Symmetry of Action-Choices is a simplification of Transitions that have identical effect in the state space"
  
  utter_greet:
  - text: "Hey! How are you?"
  
  utter_ideology:
  - text: "I can suggest a rational strategy for your decision problem that humans fail to take the right decision most of the times by thinking "

  utter_tiger_problem:
  - text: "Imagine you are standing in front of two closed doors. Behind one of the doors is a tiger and behind the other is a large reward. If you open the door with the tiger, then a large penalty is received (presumably in the form of some amount of bodily injury). Instead of opening one of the two doors, you can listen, in order to gain some information about the location of the tiger. Unfortunately, listening is not free; in addition, it is also not entirely accurate. There is a chance that you will hear a tiger behind the left-hand door when the tiger is really behind the right-hand door, and vice versa"

  utter_states:
  - text: "State: Is a real world static outlook of a problem that is fixed and doesn't change by itself.For Example: In Tiger Problem the states are defined as :Tiger on the left and Tiger on the right. Go ahead and input your states in the following input box as comma separated"

  utter_actions:
  - text: "Action-Choices are real world entities that operate on states and when you perform a specific action, it may result in a state change which we call as Transition of the problem. For Example: In the Tiger Problem, actions are defined as : Open Left Door (OL),Open Right door (OR),and Listen growl (L). Go ahead and input your actions in the following input box as comma separated (For Example,OL,OR,L) and then click 'Done'"
  
  utter_transitions:
  - text: "Transition: can be thought of as a mathematical vector that has a direction and magnitude. Direction can be thought of as going from one state to another if you perform a specific action in one state. Example: In Tiger Problem, the transitions are defined as : Tiger on the left (TL) to Tiger on the right (TR): TL2TR if you perform action Open Left and Tiger on the right (TR):Open Left (OL), Listen (L), thus we observe that if the Tiger is on the left then the preferred action would be to open the right door and the next preferred action would be to listen. Go ahead and select your transitions from the following.(For Example:OL,L) and then click 'Done'"

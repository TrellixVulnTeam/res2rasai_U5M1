  utter_preferences:
  - text: "A preference is an ordered list of decision choices for each state. You prefer performing the first decision in the preference set over the next at that state. Obviously, there should be at least one preferred decision in each state and a state need not have all choices listed in its preference set. If you are indifferent between some choices, then just list those in any order.Go ahead and enter your preferences as a comma-separated list for each state (For example, OL, L)."
  
  utter_preferences_example:
  - text: "For example, in the Tiger Problem, the preferences are defined for Tiger on the left (TL) as Open the right door (OR), Listen (L), and for Tiger on the right (TR) as Open the left door (OL), Listen (L). Thus, we observe that if the Tiger is behind the left door, then the preferred action would be to open the right door and the next preferred action would be to listen. "
  
  utter_symmetry:
  - text: "Symmetric Action-Choice are those actions that have an identical effect on the states of the problem."
  
  utter_greet:
  - text: "Hello! How may I help you today?"
  
  utter_ideology:
  - text: "I can suggest a rational strategy for your decision problem. "

  utter_tiger_problem:
  - text: "Imagine you are standing in front of two closed doors. Behind one of the doors is a tiger and behind the other is a large reward. If you open the door with the tiger, then a large penalty is received (presumably in the form of some amount of bodily injury). Instead of opening one of the two doors, you can listen, in order to gain some information about the location of the tiger. Unfortunately, listening is not free; in addition, it is also not entirely accurate. There is a chance that you will hear a tiger behind the left-hand door when the tiger is really behind the right-hand door, and vice versa"

  utter_states:
  - text: "A state of your problem can be thought of as a fixed situation at a given point of time and it may change by performing an action. For example: In the Tiger Problem the states are the Tiger is behind the left door (TL) and Tiger is behind the right door (TR). Go ahead and list all your states as comma-separated labels."

  utter_actions:
  - text: "Decision choices are usually actions that are available to you. They operate on states, and when you perform some action, it may result in a state change, which we will call as a transition of the state. For Example: In the Tiger Problem, the decision choices are open the left door (OL), open the right door (OR), and listen for growls (L); the first two impact the location of the Tiger. Go ahead and enter all your choices as comma-separated labels (for example, OL, OR, L)."
  
  utter_transitions:
  - text: "Transition: can be thought of as a mathematical vector that has a direction and magnitude. Direction can be thought of as going from one state to another if you perform a specific action in one state. Example: In Tiger Problem, the transitions are defined as : Tiger on the left (TL) to Tiger on the right (TR): TL2TR if you perform action Open Left and Tiger on the right (TR):Open Left (OL), Listen (L), thus we observe that if the Tiger is on the left then the preferred action would be to open the right door and the next preferred action would be to listen. Go ahead and select your transitions from the following.(For Example:OL,L) and then click 'Done'"

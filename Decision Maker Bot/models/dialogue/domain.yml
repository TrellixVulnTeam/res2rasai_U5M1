  utter_actions:
  - text: 'Action-Choices are real world entities that operate on states and when
      you perform a specific action, it may result in a state change which we call
      as Transition of the problem. For Example: In the Tiger Problem, actions are
      defined as : Open Left Door (OL),Open Right door (OR),and Listen growl (L).
      Go ahead and input your actions in the following input box as comma separated
      (For Example,OL,OR,L) and then click ''Done'''

  - text: Good

  utter_greet:
  - text: Hey! How are you?
  utter_ideology:
  - text: 'I can suggest a rational strategy for your decision problem that humans
      fail to take the right decision most of the times by thinking '
  utter_states:
  - text: 'State: Is a real world static outlook of a problem that is fixed and doesn''t
      change by itself.For Example: In Tiger Problem the states are defined as :Tiger
      on the left and Tiger on the right. Go ahead and input your states in the following
      input box as comma separated'
  utter_tiger_problem:
  - text: Imagine you are standing in front of two closed doors. Behind one of the
      doors is a tiger and behind the other is a large reward. If you open the door
      with the tiger, then a large penalty is received (presumably in the form of
      some amount of bodily injury). Instead of opening one of the two doors, you
      can listen, in order to gain some information about the location of the tiger.
      Unfortunately, listening is not free; in addition, it is also not entirely accurate.
      There is a chance that you will hear a tiger behind the left-hand door when
      the tiger is really behind the right-hand door, and vice versa
  utter_transitions:
  - text: 'Transition: can be thought of as a mathematical vector that has a direction
      and magnitude. Direction can be thought of as going from one state to another
      if you perform a specific action in one state. Example: In Tiger Problem, the
      transitions are defined as : Tiger on the left (TL) to Tiger on the right (TR):
      TL2TR if you perform action Open Left and Tiger on the right (TR):Open Left
      (OL), Listen (L), thus we observe that if the Tiger is on the left then the
      preferred action would be to open the right door and the next preferred action
      would be to listen. Go ahead and select your transitions from the following.(For
      Example:OL,L) and then click ''Done'''

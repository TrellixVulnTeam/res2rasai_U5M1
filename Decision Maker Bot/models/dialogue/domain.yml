  utter_actions:
  - text: 'Action-Choices are real world entities that operate on states and when
      you perform a specific action, it may result in a state change which we call
      as Transition of the problem. For Example: In the Tiger Problem, actions are
      defined as : Open Left Door (OL),Open Right door (OR),and Listen growl (L).
      Go ahead and input your actions in the specified input box as comma separated
      (For Example,OL,OR,L) and then click ''Done'''
  utter_affirm:
  - text: Good
  - text: Perfect
  utter_chances:
  - text: text:"Chance can be thought of as a number in the range of 1 to 100 that
      captures your confidence in the transition happening, given that you perform
      a specific action-choice. For example, in Tiger-problem, confidence that by
      choosing action-choice Open Left and transitioning from state Tiger Left to
      Tiger Right is 50%, meaning that I'm 50% confident that tiger would be on right
      if I open the left door, given the tiger is on left. "
  utter_goodbye:
  - text: text:"Bye"
  utter_greet:
  - text: Hey! How are you?
  utter_ideology:
  - text: 'I can suggest a rational strategy for your decision problem that humans
      fail to take the right decision most of the times by thinking '
  utter_observations:
  - text: Your observations inform you about the possible state of the problem on
      performing actions that lead to the observation. In tiger problem, growl from
      right is one of the observation variables which is associated with state 'tiger
      on right' which is updated by choosing to perform action-choice Listen.
  utter_preferences:
  - text: 'Preference is a set of choices of actions for each state where the first
      action in the preference set has the highest or equal priority over the next
      action. There needs to be at least one preferred action to each state and any
      state need not have all actions in it''s preference set. Example: In Tiger Problem,
      the preferences are defined as : Tiger on the left (TL): Open Right (OR),Listen
      (L) and Tiger on the right (TR):Open Left (OL), Listen (L), thus we observe
      that if the Tiger is on the left then the preferred action would be to open
      the right door and the next preferred action would be to listen. Enter your
      preferences in the specified input box as comma separated (For Example- OL,L)
      and then click ''Done'''
  utter_states:
  - text: 'State can be thought as a fixed situation at a given point of time and
      it may change by performing an action.For Example: In Tiger Problem the states
      are defined as :Tiger on the left and Tiger on the right. Go ahead and input
      your states in the specified input box as comma separated'
  utter_symmetry:
  - text: Symmetric Action-Choice are those actions that have an identical effect
      on the states of the problem.
  utter_tiger_problem:
  - text: Imagine you are standing in front of two closed doors. Behind one of the
      doors is a tiger and behind the other is a large reward. If you open the door
      with the tiger, then a large penalty is received (presumably in the form of
      some amount of bodily injury). Instead of opening one of the two doors, you
      can listen, in order to gain some information about the location of the tiger.
      Unfortunately, listening is not free; in addition, it is also not entirely accurate.
      There is a chance that you will hear a tiger behind the left-hand door when
      the tiger is really behind the right-hand door, and vice versa
  utter_transitions:
  - text: 'Transition: can be thought of as a mathematical vector that has a direction
      and magnitude. Direction can be thought of as going from one state to another
      if you perform a specific action in one state. Example: In Tiger Problem, the
      transitions are defined as : Tiger on the left (TL) to Tiger on the right (TR):
      TL2TR if you perform action Open Left and Tiger on the right (TR):Open Left
      (OL), Listen (L), thus we observe that if the Tiger is on the left then the
      preferred action would be to open the right door and the next preferred action
      would be to listen. Go ahead and select your transitions from the provided list
      by removing unnecessary transitions on clicking ''cross'' button next to them.(For
      Example: Transition from Tiger on the left to Tiger on the right isn''t possible
      on performing action-choice Listen) and then click ''Done'''
